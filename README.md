# SIMscraper
An alternative interface to the SIMconnect website.
<br/><br/>

## Technical Details
Uses Node.js and Express.js for the backend, running puppeteer to scrape the SIMconnect website as it doesn't have a public API ðŸ˜’.  
Uses React.js on the frontend to display the UI and make my life easier.  
The whole project was written in TypeScript since I find it to apparently be way better than JavaScript.
